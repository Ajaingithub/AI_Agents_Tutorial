Let me read the research brief carefully and understand the requirements.\\n\\nThe research brief is comprehensive and covers:\\n1. Geographic scope: Hauts-de-France, Normandy, northern portions of Grand Est (Ardennes, Meuse, Meurthe-et-Moselle) and Île-de-France. It wants separate analysis for coastal zones, inland areas, and urban heat islands (Lille, Rouen, Strasbourg, Paris).\\n2. Time period: 1991-2020 climatological normals, with recent trends 2000-2023. Exclude future projections unless specified.\\n3. Essential climate variables: Temperature, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, wind, sunshine, pressure systems, extreme events.\\n4. Data sources: Météo-France, E-OBS, academic journals, IPCC AR6.\\n5. Analytical dimensions: Maritime vs continental gradient, seasonal patterns, topographic effects, NAO, urban-rural contrasts, climate change signals.\\n6. Mandatory visualizations & tables: Table 1 (seasonal metrics for 5 stations), Table 2 (comparison of northern France... the text cuts off but I can infer it should be comparison with other regions or within the region).\\n\\nThe user wants me to break this into 3-8 coherent, non-overlapping subtasks that can be researched independently. Each subtask needs an id, title, and description.\\n\\nLet me think about how to group this:\\n\\nOption 1: Group by geographic dimension\\n- Coastal zones\\n- Inland areas\\n- Urban areas\\nBut this might lead to duplication of variables.\\n\\nOption 2: Group by thematic dimension\\n- Temperature analysis\\n- Precipitation analysis\\n- Other variables (wind, humidity, etc.)\\n- Climate patterns and mechanisms\\n- Climate change trends\\n- Urban heat island effects\\nThis seems better as it avoids duplication and allows agents to focus on specific variables across the region.\\n\\nOption 3: Group by analytical dimension\\n- Maritime vs continental gradient\\n- Seasonal patterns\\n- NAO influence\\n- Urban-rural contrasts\\n- Climate change signals\\nThis might overlap too much with variables.\\n\\nI think Option 2 is best, but I need to ensure comprehensive coverage. Let me structure it:\\n\\n1. **Geographic and Administrative Framework** - Define the study area boundaries, identify key sub-regions (coastal, inland, urban), and establish the station network for analysis. This is foundational.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Regime Analysis** - Research all temperature-related variables across the region: means, extremes, diurnal range, frost days, growing degree days, urban heat island effects for specified cities.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation and Moisture Characteristics** - Research precipitation totals, intensity, rainy days, snow, hail, plus atmospheric moisture (humidity, dew point, fog).\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Atmospheric Patterns** - Research wind characteristics, sunshine hours, cloud cover, and pressure systems including NAO influence.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Weather Events** - Focus on extreme events: heavy precipitation, heatwaves, cold snaps, return periods, storm days.\\n\\n6. **Climate Change Trends and Spatial Gradients** - Analyze temporal trends (2000-2023 vs 1991-2020) and spatial gradients (maritime-continental, topographic effects).\\n\\n7. **Data Compilation and Station Analysis** - Create the mandatory tables with data from the 5 representative stations, ensuring data quality and consistency.\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider. The user wants subtasks that can be researched independently. Subtask 7 seems like it might depend on others. Also, the urban heat island is mentioned in multiple places. Let me refine:\\n\\nBetter grouping:\\n\\n1. **Geographic Scope and Spatial Framework** - Define exact boundaries, identify coastal/inland zones, establish urban/rural comparison areas, and select representative stations.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Dynamics and Urban Heat Islands** - Comprehensive temperature analysis including all metrics and specific focus on UHI for Lille, Rouen, Strasbourg, Paris.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation, Moisture, and Topographic Effects** - All precipitation variables, atmospheric moisture, and influence of topography (Ardennes, Normandy hills).\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Synoptic Patterns** - Wind, sunshine, cloud cover, and pressure systems with NAO correlation.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Events and Return Periods** - Dedicated analysis of extreme weather events and statistical return periods.\\n\\n6. **Climate Change Signal Detection** - Trend analysis comparing 1991-2020 normals with 2000-2023 data, significance testing, maritime vs continental gradient changes.\\n\\n7. **Data Synthesis and Quality Control** - Compile all data from specified sources, create mandatory tables, ensure consistency.\\n\\nHmm, but Data Synthesis might not be \"independent\" - it relies on others. Let me think differently.\\n\\nAlternative approach - group by data source and analysis type:\\n\\n1. **Météo-France Station Data Analysis** - Extract and analyze official data for the 5 mandatory stations and other key locations, covering all variables.\\n\\n2. **Gridded Dataset Spatial Analysis** - Use E-OBS for spatial patterns, gradients, and topographic effects.\\n\\n3. **Temperature and Urban Climate** - Dedicated deep dive on temperature variables and urban heat islands.\\n\\n4. **Precipitation and Moisture Regime** - Dedicated deep dive on precipitation and humidity.\\n\\n5. **Atmospheric Circulation and Extremes** - Wind, pressure systems, NAO, and extreme events.\\n\\n6. **Climate Change and Trend Analysis** - Temporal analysis across all variables.\\n\\n7. **Literature Review and Contextualization** - Academic sources and IPCC context.\\n\\nBut this might be too overlapping. Let me go back to my previous structure and refine it to be truly independent.\\n\\nA better approach: each agent should be able to work with the sources to gather specific information without waiting for others.\\n\\nFinal structure:\\n\\n1. **Geographic Definition and Spatial Framework** - Define boundaries, zones, stations, and prepare spatial analysis framework.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Regime and Urban Heat Island Analysis** - All temperature metrics with explicit urban-rural comparisons.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation, Snow, and Atmospheric Moisture** - All water-related variables including topographic effects.\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Synoptic Climate Patterns** - Wind, solar, cloud, and pressure system analysis including NAO.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Weather Events and Return Periods** - Focus on statistical extremes across variables.\\n\\n6. **Maritime-Continental Gradient and Seasonal Patterns** - Spatial gradients and seasonal cycle analysis.\\n\\n7. **Climate Change Signal Detection and Trend Analysis** - Temporal trends and significance testing.\\n\\nThis gives 7 subtasks, each focused on a distinct analytical dimension but covering all variables. They can research their topic across the entire region using the specified sources.\\n\\nLet me write detailed descriptions for each:\\n\\n1. **subtask-01-geographic-framework**: Should define exactly what \"northern France\" means per the brief, identify coastal zones (Dunkirk to Le Havre), inland plateaus, and urban areas. Select the 5 stations plus additional representative stations. Create maps/zones.\\n\\n2. **subtask-02-temperature**: Research all temperature aspects - means, extremes, diurnal range, frost days, growing degree days. For Lille, Paris, Rouen, Strasbourg, include urban vs rural comparisons. Use Météo-France data and E-OBS for spatial patterns.\\n\\n3. **subtask-03-precipitation-moisture**: Research precipitation totals, rainy days, intensity percentiles, snow frequency, hail, relative humidity, dew point, fog days. Include topographic effects from Ardennes and Normandy hills.\\n\\n4. **subtask-04-wind-sunshine-pressure**: Wind direction/speed, storm days, sunshine hours, cloud cover, pressure systems, NAO correlation with winter anomalies.\\n\\n5. **subtask-05-extreme-events**: 24h precipitation >50mm return periods, heatwaves (>30°C), cold snaps (<-5°C), statistical analysis.\\n\\n6. **subtask-06-spatial-gradients-seasons**: Quantify maritime-continental transition, seasonal patterns (winter moderation vs summer convection), topographic influence on precipitation.\\n\\n7. **subtask-07-climate-change-trends**: Compare 1991-2020 vs 2000-2023 trends, significance testing, temperature/precipitation changes 1950-2023 if data available.\\n\\nWait, the brief says \"If I don\\'t respond, proceed with the four-region definition above\" - so I should make that assumption explicit in the descriptions.\\n\\nAlso, the brief mentions \"Table 2: Comparison of northern France\" - it\\'s cut off, but I should include preparation of both mandatory tables in one subtask. Let me assign that to the framework subtask or create a dedicated synthesis subtask? But the user said not to include a final integration task. So I should distribute table creation:\\n\\n- Table 1 (seasonal metrics for 5 stations) could be compiled by each subtask providing their variable data, but that requires coordination. Better to have one subtask compile it from sources.\\n\\nActually, re-reading the requirement: \"Each description should be very clear and detailed about everything that the agent needs to research to cover that topic.\" So each agent should gather the data for their topic. The table creation is a deliverable that will happen later.\\n\\nLet me restructure to be more independent:\\n\\n1. **Geographic and Zonal Definition** - Purely about defining the study area, zones, stations, and spatial framework. No climate data analysis.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Analysis** - All temperature variables, including urban heat islands.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation and Moisture Analysis** - All precipitation and humidity variables.\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Atmospheric Circulation** - Wind, solar, cloud, pressure, NAO.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Events Analysis** - Statistical extremes and return periods.\\n\\n6. **Spatial and Temporal Climate Patterns** - Maritime-continental gradient, seasonal patterns, topographic effects, AND climate change trends (combining two analytical dimensions to stay within 6-7 tasks).\\n\\nThis gives 6 subtasks. But climate change trends might be better separate.\\n\\nLet me try again:\\n\\n1. **Geographic Scope and Station Network** (id: geo-framework)\\n2. **Temperature Regime and Urban Climate** (id: temperature)\\n3. **Precipitation, Snow, and Atmospheric Moisture** (id: precipitation)\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Synoptic Patterns** (id: circulation)\\n5. **Extreme Weather Events** (id: extremes)\\n6. **Spatial Climate Gradients** (id: spatial-patterns)\\n7. **Climate Change Trends and Signals** (id: climate-change)\\n\\nThis is 7 tasks, which is good. Each is independent and covers a distinct aspect. The geographic framework task is foundational but can be done independently first. The others can proceed in parallel once the framework is established, or even independently by using the brief\\'s geographic definition.\\n\\nLet me write detailed descriptions now, ensuring I include all specifics from the brief:\\n\\n- Mention the four-region assumption\\n- Include all required variables per topic\\n- Specify data sources to use\\n- Mention analytical dimensions relevant to each task\\n- Include the mandatory stations where relevant\\n- Make clear what needs to be delivered\\n\\nFor subtask 1: Should define boundaries, identify coastal zone (Dunkirk to Le Havre), inland plateaus (Artois, Flanders, Picardy), urban areas (Lille, Rouen, Strasbourg, Paris), select representative stations beyond the mandatory 5, and prepare to quantify maritime-continental gradient.\\n\\nFor subtask 2: Temperature means, extremes, diurnal range, frost days, growing degree days, urban-rural contrasts for the 4 cities, using Météo-France and E-OBS.\\n\\nFor subtask 3: Precipitation totals, rainy days, intensity percentiles, snow frequency, hail, relative humidity, dew point, fog days, topographic effects from Ardennes and Normandy hills.\\n\\nFor subtask 4: Wind direction, speed, storm/gale days, sunshine hours, cloud cover, pressure systems, NAO correlation with winter temperature/precipitation anomalies.\\n\\nFor subtask 5: Return periods for 24h precipitation >50mm, heatwaves >30°C, cold snaps <-5°C, statistical analysis methods.\\n\\nFor subtask 6: Quantify maritime-continental transition, seasonal patterns (winter moderation vs summer convection), topographic precipitation effects, using E-OBS for spatial analysis.\\n\\nFor subtask 7: Compare 1991-2020 normals with 2000-2023 trends, significance testing, trend analysis 1950-2023 if available, using Météo-France data and IPCC AR6 context.\\n\\nI should also mention that Table 1 will be compiled from data across subtasks, but each subtask should provide data for it. However, to avoid coordination issues, maybe subtask 1 should compile Table 1? But that would require it to gather data from other domains. Better to have each subtask generate their part, and the integration happens later (which the user said they\\'ll do).\\n\\nActually, looking at the brief again: \"Include exactly these tables: Table 1: Seasonal climate metrics... Table 2: Comparison of northern France\". This suggests these are deliverables of the overall report, not necessarily of a single subtask. So subtasks should research the data needed for these tables, but not necessarily finalize them.\\n\\nLet me finalize my subtask list:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"subtasks\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"geo-framework\",\\n      \"title\": \"Geographic Scope and Spatial Framework Definition\",\\n      \"description\": \"Define the exact spatial boundaries of the study area per the research brief: Hauts-de-France, Normandy, northern Grand Est (Ardennes, Meuse, Meurthe-et-Moselle), and Île-de-France.

Let me refine:\\n\\nBetter grouping:\\n\\n1. **Geographic Scope and Spatial Framework** - Define exact boundaries, identify coastal/inland zones, establish urban/rural comparison areas, and select representative stations.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Dynamics and Urban Heat Islands** - Comprehensive temperature analysis including all metrics and specific focus on UHI for Lille, Rouen, Strasbourg, Paris.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation, Moisture, and Topographic Effects** - All precipitation variables, atmospheric moisture, and influence of topography (Ardennes, Normandy hills).\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Synoptic Patterns** - Wind, sunshine, cloud cover, and pressure systems with NAO correlation.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Events and Return Periods** - Dedicated analysis of extreme weather events and statistical return periods.\\n\\n6. **Climate Change Signal Detection** - Trend analysis comparing 1991-2020 normals with 2000-2023 data, significance testing, maritime vs continental gradient changes.\\n\\n7. **Data Synthesis and Quality Control** - Compile all data from specified sources, create mandatory tables, ensure consistency.\\n\\nHmm, but Data Synthesis might not be \"independent\" - it relies on others. Let me think differently.\\n\\nAlternative approach - group by data source and analysis type:\\n\\n1. **Météo-France Station Data Analysis** - Extract and analyze official data for the 5 mandatory stations and other key locations, covering all variables.\\n\\n2. **Gridded Dataset Spatial Analysis** - Use E-OBS for spatial patterns, gradients, and topographic effects.\\n\\n3. **Temperature and Urban Climate** - Dedicated deep dive on temperature variables and urban heat islands.\\n\\n4. **Precipitation and Moisture Regime** - Dedicated deep dive on precipitation and humidity.\\n\\n5. **Atmospheric Circulation and Extremes** - Wind, pressure systems, NAO, and extreme events.\\n\\n6. **Climate Change and Trend Analysis** - Temporal analysis across all variables.\\n\\n7. **Literature Review and Contextualization** - Academic sources and IPCC context.\\n\\nBut this might be too overlapping. Let me go back to my previous structure and refine it to be truly independent.\\n\\nA better approach: each agent should be able to work with the sources to gather specific information without waiting for others.\\n\\nFinal structure:\\n\\n1. **Geographic Definition and Spatial Framework** - Define boundaries, zones, stations, and prepare spatial analysis framework.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Regime and Urban Heat Island Analysis** - All temperature metrics with explicit urban-rural comparisons.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation, Snow, and Atmospheric Moisture** - All water-related variables including topographic effects.\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Synoptic Climate Patterns** - Wind, solar, cloud, and pressure system analysis including NAO.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Weather Events and Return Periods** - Focus on statistical extremes across variables.\\n\\n6. **Maritime-Continental Gradient and Seasonal Patterns** - Spatial gradients and seasonal cycle analysis.\\n\\n7. **Climate Change Signal Detection and Trend Analysis** - Temporal trends and significance testing.\\n\\nThis gives 7 subtasks, each focused on a distinct analytical dimension but covering all variables. They can research their topic across the entire region using the specified sources.\\n\\nLet me write detailed descriptions for each:\\n\\n1. **subtask-01-geographic-framework**: Should define exactly what \"northern France\" means per the brief, identify coastal zones (Dunkirk to Le Havre), inland plateaus, and urban areas. Select the 5 stations plus additional representative stations. Create maps/zones.\\n\\n2. **subtask-02-temperature**: Research all temperature aspects - means, extremes, diurnal range, frost days, growing degree days. For Lille, Paris, Rouen, Strasbourg, include urban vs rural comparisons. Use Météo-France data and E-OBS for spatial patterns.\\n\\n3. **subtask-03-precipitation-moisture**: Research precipitation totals, rainy days, intensity percentiles, snow frequency, hail, relative humidity, dew point, fog days. Include topographic effects from Ardennes and Normandy hills.\\n\\n4. **subtask-04-wind-sunshine-pressure**: Wind direction/speed, storm days, sunshine hours, cloud cover, pressure systems, NAO correlation with winter anomalies.\\n\\n5. **subtask-05-extreme-events**: 24h precipitation >50mm return periods, heatwaves (>30°C), cold snaps (<-5°C), statistical analysis.\\n\\n6. **subtask-06-spatial-gradients-seasons**: Quantify maritime-continental transition, seasonal patterns (winter moderation vs summer convection), topographic influence on precipitation.\\n\\n7. **subtask-07-climate-change-trends**: Compare 1991-2020 vs 2000-2023 trends, significance testing, temperature/precipitation changes 1950-2023 if data available.\\n\\nWait, the brief says \"If I don\\'t respond, proceed with the four-region definition above\" - so I should make that assumption explicit in the descriptions.\\n\\nAlso, the brief mentions \"Table 2: Comparison of northern France\" - it\\'s cut off, but I should include preparation of both mandatory tables in one subtask. Let me assign that to the framework subtask or create a dedicated synthesis subtask? But the user said not to include a final integration task. So I should distribute table creation:\\n\\n- Table 1 (seasonal metrics for 5 stations) could be compiled by each subtask providing their variable data, but that requires coordination. Better to have one subtask compile it from sources.\\n\\nActually, re-reading the requirement: \"Each description should be very clear and detailed about everything that the agent needs to research to cover that topic.\" So each agent should gather the data for their topic. The table creation is a deliverable that will happen later.\\n\\nLet me restructure to be more independent:\\n\\n1. **Geographic and Zonal Definition** - Purely about defining the study area, zones, stations, and spatial framework. No climate data analysis.\\n\\n2. **Temperature Analysis** - All temperature variables, including urban heat islands.\\n\\n3. **Precipitation and Moisture Analysis** - All precipitation and humidity variables.\\n\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Atmospheric Circulation** - Wind, solar, cloud, pressure, NAO.\\n\\n5. **Extreme Events Analysis** - Statistical extremes and return periods.\\n\\n6. **Spatial and Temporal Climate Patterns** - Maritime-continental gradient, seasonal patterns, topographic effects, AND climate change trends (combining two analytical dimensions to stay within 6-7 tasks).\\n\\nThis gives 6 subtasks. But climate change trends might be better separate.\\n\\nLet me try again:\\n\\n1. **Geographic Scope and Station Network** (id: geo-framework)\\n2. **Temperature Regime and Urban Climate** (id: temperature)\\n3. **Precipitation, Snow, and Atmospheric Moisture** (id: precipitation)\\n4. **Wind, Sunshine, and Synoptic Patterns** (id: circulation)\\n5. **Extreme Weather Events** (id: extremes)\\n6. **Spatial Climate Gradients** (id: spatial-patterns)\\n7. **Climate Change Trends and Signals** (id: climate-change)\\n\\nThis is 7 tasks, which is good. Each is independent and covers a distinct aspect. The geographic framework task is foundational but can be done independently first. The others can proceed in parallel once the framework is established, or even independently by using the brief\\'s geographic definition.\\n\\nLet me write detailed descriptions now, ensuring I include all specifics from the brief:\\n\\n- Mention the four-region assumption\\n- Include all required variables per topic\\n- Specify data sources to use\\n- Mention analytical dimensions relevant to each task\\n- Include the mandatory stations where relevant\\n- Make clear what needs to be delivered\\n\\nFor subtask 1: Should define boundaries, identify coastal zone (Dunkirk to Le Havre), inland plateaus (Artois, Flanders, Picardy), urban areas (Lille, Rouen, Strasbourg, Paris), select representative stations beyond the mandatory 5, and prepare to quantify maritime-continental gradient.\\n\\nFor subtask 2: Temperature means, extremes, diurnal range, frost days, growing degree days, urban-rural contrasts for the 4 cities, using Météo-France and E-OBS.\\n\\nFor subtask 3: Precipitation totals, rainy days, intensity percentiles, snow frequency, hail, relative humidity, dew point, fog days, topographic effects from Ardennes and Normandy hills.\\n\\nFor subtask 4: Wind direction, speed, storm/gale days, sunshine hours, cloud cover, pressure systems, NAO correlation with winter temperature/precipitation anomalies.\\n\\nFor subtask 5: Return periods for 24h precipitation >50mm, heatwaves >30°C, cold snaps <-5°C, statistical analysis methods.\\n\\nFor subtask 6: Quantify maritime-continental transition, seasonal patterns (winter moderation vs summer convection), topographic precipitation effects, using E-OBS for spatial analysis.\\n\\nFor subtask 7: Compare 1991-2020 normals with 2000-2023 trends, significance testing, trend analysis 1950-2023 if available, using Météo-France data and IPCC AR6 context.\\n\\nI should also mention that Table 1 will be compiled from data across subtasks, but each subtask should provide data for it. However, to avoid coordination issues, maybe subtask 1 should compile Table 1? But that would require it to gather data from other domains. Better to have each subtask generate their part, and the integration happens later (which the user said they\\'ll do).\\n\\nActually, looking at the brief again: \"Include exactly these tables: Table 1: Seasonal climate metrics... Table 2: Comparison of northern France\". This suggests these are deliverables of the overall report, not necessarily of a single subtask. So subtasks should research the data needed for these tables, but not necessarily finalize them.\\n\\nLet me finalize my subtask list:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"subtasks\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"geo-framework\",\\n      \"title\": \"Geographic Scope and Spatial Framework Definition\",\\n      \"description\": \"Define the exact spatial boundaries of the study area per the research brief: Hauts-de-France, Normandy, northern Grand Est (Ardennes, Meuse, Meurthe-et-Moselle), and Île-de-France.
